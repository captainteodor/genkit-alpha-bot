2. Include descriptions that match the user's goal in the suggested archetype context.
3. Adjust the tone to be **playfully sarcastic, but friendly and non-offensive**. Avoid any overly harsh language.
4. Output ONLY a JSON object in this format:
{
  "response": "Brief overview of suggestions",
  "archetypes": ["Archetype 1", "Archetype 2", "Archetype 3","Load More Archetypes"]
}
